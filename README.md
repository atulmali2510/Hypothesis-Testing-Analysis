# Hypothesis Testing & Product Performance Analysis 🧪📊

This project demonstrates statistical hypothesis testing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python on a retail sales dataset.

## 🔍 Objective
To explore product performance, analyze trends, and apply statistical inference through hypothesis testing.

## 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains customer purchases with details like:
- Date, Customer Age, Gender
- Product Category & Sub-category
- Unit Cost, Price, Revenue

## 🧼 Steps Performed

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Univariate Analysis (distribution, boxplots)  
3. Bivariate Analysis (Revenue by Gender/Category)  
4. Hypothesis Testing (t-tests, comparison of means)  
5. Top & Bottom Products (by revenue, profit, quantity)  
6. Multivariate Correlation & Monthly Revenue Trend  

## 📈 Libraries Used
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy.stats`

## 📊 Key Insights
- Product categories like **Helmets** and **Tires & Tubes** generated the highest profit
- Monthly revenue trend is consistent with product quantity and customer age
- Strong positive correlation found between unit price and revenue

## 📝 Files Included
- `Hypothesis testing.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with full analysis  
- `Hypothesis testing.pdf` - PDF version for quick reference
